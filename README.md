# Points of Interest

A [ðŸŒ€Run Tests](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-cicd/blob/main/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml) workflow is automatically triggered when code is changed in the `main` branch. 

This workflow does the following:

1. Launch 2 GitHub hosted runners: `windows-latest` `macos-latest`
2. Checkout the current repository
3. Checkout the latest [`compiler`](https://github.com/miyako/4d-class-compiler) project from releases
4. Download [`tool4d`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/cli/#using-tool4d)
5. Run a specific [`--startup-method`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/cli/#launch-a-4d-application) with `tool4d` and `compiler` project 

Sample result: [actions/runs/8025901243](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-cicd/actions/runs/8025901243)

Only changes relevant to code execution will trigger the workflow:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
    paths:
      - '*/Project/Sources/**/*.4dm'
      - '*/Project/Sources/*/*.4DForm'
      - '*/Project/Sources/*.4DCatalog' 
```

A specific branch, product and build of `tool4d` is used:

```yml
jobs:     

  get:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        TOOL4D_PLATFORM: ["windows-latest", "macos-latest"]
        TOOL4D_BRANCH: [20.x]
        TOOL4D_VERSION: [20.2]
        TOOL4D_BUILD: [latest] 
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_PLATFORM }}
    steps:

      - name: checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
      - name: get tool4d
        id: get
        uses: miyako/4D/.github/actions/get-tool@v1
        with:
          platform: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_PLATFORM }}
          branch: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_BRANCH }}
          version: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_VERSION }}
          build: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_BUILD }}
```

Any combination of runners, `tool4d`, projects, `--startup-method` can be specified in a strategy matrix:

```yml
jobs:     

  get:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        TOOL4D_BUILD: [latest] 
        TOOL4D_STARTUP_METHOD: [test] 
        TOOL4D_STARTUP_PROJECT_PATH: [./application/Project/application.4DProject] 
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_PLATFORM }}
    steps:

      - name: run tests
        uses: ./.github/actions/run-tests
        with:
          tool4d_download_url: ${{ steps.get.outputs.tool4d_download_url }}
          tool4d_executable_path: ${{ steps.get.outputs.tool4d_executable_path }}
          startup_method: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_STARTUP_METHOD }}
          project_path: ${{ matrix.TOOL4D_STARTUP_PROJECT_PATH }}        
```

A [ðŸŽ‰Build and Publish](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-cicd/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml) workflow can be trigged manually.

This workflow does the following:

1. Prompt to choose the kind of version bump: `patch`, `minor`, `major`
2. Update `package.json` at the root of the project (the version information in this file is incorporated in the build process)
3. Create a release that corresponds to the new version
4. Connect to a self-hosted runner (build must always take place on a self-hosted runner with licenses installed)
5. (Do not run units tests, which would have been done already on GitHub hosted runners, as described above)
6. Checkout the current repository
7. Checkout the latest [`compiler`](https://github.com/miyako/4d-class-compiler) project from releases
8. Download [`tool4d`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/cli/#using-tool4d)
9. Build, sign, archive, notarise, staple the product
10. Uploaded .dmg to the release created earlier

Sample result: [actions/runs/8026370678](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-cicd/actions/runs/8026370678)

This workflow is also triggered automatically, according to the same filter as `ðŸŒ€Run Tests`.

1. (Do not prompt for inputs)
2. (Do not bump the version)
3. (Do not create releases)
4. Connect to a self-hosted runner (build must always take place on a self-hosted runner with licenses installed)
5. Run unit tests
6. Checkout the current repository
7. Checkout the latest [`compiler`](https://github.com/miyako/4d-class-compiler) project from releases
8. Download [`tool4d`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Admin/cli/#using-tool4d)
9. Build, sign the product
10. (Do not archive or upload the .app)

Sample result: [actions/runs/8026309928](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-cicd/actions/runs/8026309928)

Because the `deployment` job needs the `release` job, it is important to checkout the repository with `ref: ${{ github.ref }}` to get the latest commit from the `bump` job. Otherwise, the commit that is checked out would be from the moment the workflow was triggered which is a version behind.

# Remarks

Although one can [configure the self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=mac), the codesign script seems to fail when executed in a background process (maybe there is a workaround, don't know). For the purpose of building 4D applications, it seems better to `./ron.sh` the runner in a Terminal window, manually, or as a login item.
